The scripts which make up my practicalclouds bootstrap process.

The scripts are all written in bash shell script, and use the aws perl command line tool for accessing ec2 services.  The scripts configure a very basic AMI with the software needed when it boot, and you can control this process by entering arguments into the user-data field.  They allow you to install software, mount ebs volumes and s3 buckets, access files and backup to s3.  I've written a number of profiles which load different servers such as Drupal, Wordpress and one which creates a fully featured Puppet Master with MCollective.

The intention is to now replace these scripts with puppet modules, types and manifests.

Please browse to http://www.practicalclouds.com for more details about the scipts and profiles.
